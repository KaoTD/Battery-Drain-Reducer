There Is A Partition Called dev/ In Our Phones Which Is Of 170Mb (Xperia Mini) And Is Only 2mb to 5mb Used...!
So I Decided To Move Dalvik-Cache To This Partition...!

This Is Wht Yuh Guyx Have To Do...!
1). Do Make A Nandroid Backup Before Doing Any Thing (So That If Something Goes Wrong, Yuh Can Restore As It Were Before)
2). Extract The Attached File Then Copy The Extracted File (02dalvik2cache) To /system/etc/init.d/ ==> Yuh Can Use Root Explorer To Do This...!
3). Set Permission To rwxrwxrwx (Tick All)
4). Restart

First Boot Might Take Time...! Check Ur Internal Memory Nd If Everything Worked Fine U'll See The Difference And The Best Thing Is There Is No Performance Issue..!
FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO SAY WHY NOT MOVE IT TO SD-EXT...!
=> Sd Cards Are Not Fast As The Internal Memory Even Yuh Have A Class 10 Card...!
Moving Dalvik-Cache To Sd-Ext Might Lead Yuh To Performance Issues
In My Opinion Never Move Dalvik-Cache Or Apps Data To Sd-Ext, It Will Slow Down Everything..! If Yuh Want To Move Just Move Applications...!

If Anyone Wants To Correct Me.. Go Ahead...!
IF THIS THING HELPED YUH HIT THANKX...!=)
