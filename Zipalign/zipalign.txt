To "install" this, just adb push the two files in the zip below onto your phone with:

Code:
adb shell mount -o remount,rw /system
adb push zipalign /system/bin
adb push zipalign_apks /system/sd/zipalign_apks.sh
adb shell chmod 755 /system/bin/zipalign /system/sd/zipalign_apks.sh
adb shell mount -o remount,ro /system

Then anytime you want to run the script just do:

Code:
adb shell sh /system/sd/zipalign_apks.sh


Or in terminal:

Code:
su
sh /system/sd/zipalign_apks.sh
